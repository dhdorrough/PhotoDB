# PhotoDB
The PhotoDB program was originally designed as means of keeping track of a large number of digital photographs . Over the years it has grown to include the ability to also track video files, audio files, DVDs and documents such as MS Word, PowerPoint, text files and others.
 
It is easy to find photos and documents based on a large number of criteria such as file name, file location, file creation date or date photo was taken, date record was created, date record was updated, key words, copyright owner, file size, photo height, photo width, the latitude & longitude that a photo was taken at, document type (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, JPEG, etc). 

Video and audio files can be searched on a scene-by-scene basis to look for key words, dates, etc.
Photos and documents can be searched for using simple or complex Boolean expressions with sophisticated functionality built in to simplify looking for locations, numeric comparisons, info contained in the EXIF data of a digital photo, and much more.
